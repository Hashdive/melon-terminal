# Melon interface

> Technology regulated and operated investment funds.

## Installation

Before you can start the interface in development mode, you'll need to have [Node.js][node] and [Yarn][yarn] installed.

Installing only takes a single command and you're ready to roll:

```
yarn install
```

You are now ready to start the application:

```
yarn start
```

It should automatically open up a browser window pointing to your local development server.
